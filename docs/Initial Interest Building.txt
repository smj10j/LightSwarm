Level 2 (flesh out more)

- Encouraged to build a hospital and some hatcheries to ramp up unit production and heal wounded units faster, interest drops a little

- Prompt them to create a colo prism and attack and colonize a nearby orb, interest spikes even higher as they start to see the depth of the game

- Tell them they must colonize the remaining giant orb in the sector - recommend they acquire a massive force first - interest spikes for huge final battle
